> **Goal:** Turn a respectable simulation engine into **"the place engineers go to become *distributed-systems* architects"**
> **Sister spec:** `2026-04-20-lld-architect-studio-rebuild.md` — match its structure, tone, and lifespan
> **Status:** Design approved; implementation plan pending

## The Unifying Thesis

> **System Design is the wind tunnel. The diagram is the airframe. The outage is the stall.**
>
> Architex SD is not a canvas. It is a **drafting hall** joined to a **wind tunnel** by one seamless door.

The LLD module builds *an architect's studio* — a place where a working engineer designs a single codebase. The SD module extends that studio into its second hall: where the engineer stops drafting one program and starts drafting **an organism of many programs**. Same physical metaphor. Same serif voice. Same motion language. One accent-color swap (amber → cobalt) and a door at the far end of the studio that opens onto **the wind tunnel** — a room where every diagram the engineer has ever drawn can be run, shaken, set on fire, rewound, and argued with.

Four principles — one per area of the spec — are repeated throughout:

- **The wind-tunnel principle.** A system diagram that cannot be *run* is decoration. Every design in Architex SD must be executable against traffic, cost, and chaos. The simulation engine is not an afterthought; it is the organ around which the pedagogy is grown.
- **The war-story principle.** Distributed systems failures are myth, not trivia. Facebook 2021 BGP, AWS us-east-1 2021, CrowdStrike 2024 — each is taught as a **cinematic replay**, not a footnote. Every chaos event the user triggers is narrated in the same serif-typeset ribbon the real incidents use. The feeling should be: *"my laptop just went through what Fastly went through in 2021."*
- **The invisible-force principle.** The three forces that kill production systems — **latency, cost, and failure propagation** — are invisible in every other tool. Architex SD makes them visible, always. A latency heat overlay. A corner meter for dollars-per-second. A blast-radius graph that pulses when a node falls. You cannot hide from physics; you can only watch it.
- **The one-organism principle.** There is no "System Design app" and "LLD app" and "Algorithms app". There is one Architex, one profile, one FSRS queue, one palette, one shortcut muscle-memory. Cross-module links everywhere. The SD problem "Design Twitter" carries a link to its LLD counterpart ("Tweet feed object model") and back. Knowledge graph, not silos.

### Why this thesis drives every subsequent decision

- **The 5 modes** are not tabs. They are *rooms in the hall*: **Learn** (the reading nook), **Build** (the drafting hall), **Simulate** (the wind tunnel, flagship), **Drill** (the exam room), **Review** (the reading chair by the window). One shell, four doors, a wind tunnel at the end.
- **The content** is both **atomic (40 concepts)** and **molecular (30 problems)** — cross-linked by design, because a distributed system is simultaneously "the 40 ideas you need to have" and "the 30 questions you will be asked". You cannot teach one without the other.
- **The simulation engine is not replaced**; it is **dressed**. Architex already has 34 files of simulation infra (chaos-engine, cost-model, cascade-engine, narrative-engine, metrics-engine, queuing-model, capacity-planner, 27 more). This spec layers pedagogy on top of it — threshold coaching, whisper-mode coach, cinematic chaos, 6 activity framings. The infra stays.
- **The interview layer is gated**. The 5-stage interview clock (Clarify → Estimate → Design → Deep Dive → Q&A) is enforced in Drill mode. This is not a preference. Interviews have phases; muscle memory is what we are training.
- **Cost is never hidden.** Every node has a dollar number. The corner meter ticks. When the user adds a Global Accelerator, a diff annotation shows "+$2.40/hr". Cloud-bill shock is a teachable moment, not a surprise the user gets six months after the interview.
- **Failure is cinema.** Chaos events trigger a full-width ribbon, a red vignette, and an optional bass thump. The screen briefly belongs to the failure. Then a margin card captures it as a running narrative stream on the right, so the user can scroll back and read the story of their outage.
